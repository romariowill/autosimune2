The importance of studying the immune system comes mainly from its fundamental function in the maintenance of human life and its health. In order to help elucidating such a complex process, computational models for the immune system are applied by researchers to verify important hypotheses in a much cheaper and faster way when compared to in-vivo investigation. This project is a simulation model of the immune system that uses a multi-agent approach and seeks to broaden the level of detail of previous related works. The ultimate goal of this project is to develop a simulator of the human immune system, particularly to investigate autoimmune diseases that can be useful for teaching and for enhancing knowledge about the behavior of this intricate biological process.

AutoSimmune have been successfully used to simulate various biological phenomena related to the human immune system, such as the development of autoimmunity; verifying the role of mast cells in infections; for explaining the evolution of sepsis; and to study the immune response in the post-infectious glomerulonephritis (GnPE) by Streptococcus pyogenes.

This research  is developed by the informatics  department and the department of medicine and nursing at the Federal University of Vi√ßosa and is supported by the funding agencies FAPEMIG, CNPq, CAPES and by the Gapso company.
